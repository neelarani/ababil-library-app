/**
 * Components Barrel File
 * -------------------------------------
 * This file serves as a single entry point
 * for all components in this folder.
 *
 * Why?
 * - Cleaner imports
 * - Easier refactoring
 * - Centralized exports
 *
 * Example:
 *   import { Button, Card, Modal } from "@/components";
 *
 * Add new components below
